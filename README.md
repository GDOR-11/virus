WARNING: open a new browser window to use this, because you need to close the browser window to stop this and it won't be fun if your friend loses all his unsaved data

you may say this is not a virus because it is easy to stop it and it does nothing to your computer at all, but i googled it and the definition of a computer virus is "a piece of code which is capable of copying itself and <b>typically</b> has a detrimental effect, such as corrupting the system or destroying data.", and this code replicates itselft perfeclty (as you may have noticed lol)
